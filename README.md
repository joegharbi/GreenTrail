# GreenTrail

GreenTrail is a free-to-use web app, that helps to choose the best and most suitable way of transport based on live weather and traffic data. With this, you can reduce your CO<sup>2</sup> footprint significantly.

We started developing our product as a team project at Eötvös Loránd University.

## About the idea

### The problem

The increasing amount of air pollution causes high values of CO<sup>2</sup> in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming and climate changes by trapping heat. Transportation is one of the largest pollution sources.

### The solution

We created an application, that can suggest transportation methods based on weather and the live traffic. Just set the Source, the Destination and hit GO. We made it possible to set your preferences as well, so we can make the most fitting suggestion for your special needs.

## Development

### Members

+ **Bouafia** - Mentor
+ **Al Kadiry Mohamad** - Idea owner, Architect & Engineer
+ **Horvát Krisztofer Zoltán** - Engineer & Web API Specialist
+ **Ismael Shadi** - Developer & Spokesman
+ **Gharbi Youssef** - Full-stack developer
+ **AL-Hitawi Mohammed** - Developer & AI Specialist

### Methodology

We are using an **agile development** methodology, to deliver a reliable and environmental-frienldy application in an iterative manner. Our method lies closest to the scrum agile methodology, except we don't estimate our tasks in story points and we don't have a scrum master. We hold "sprints" with the length of 1 week. In every monday we review the result of the previous week, and set goals for the next. We also tried some XP practices like the "Planning Game", and kept those aspects, that we found useful.

### Project management

We use Trello for project management. Check out our public Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/qeb2G0I2/greentrail).

### Technologies used

+ Laravel (a PHP framework) - for back-end
+ Plain JS, and some VueJS - for front-end
+ Bootstrap 5 - for responsiveness
+ MySQL - for database
+ HERE APIs - for accessing live weather and traffic data
